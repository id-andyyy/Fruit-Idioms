# Fruit Idioms&nbsp;&#127827;

A website for learning English idioms with the meaning of "Fruit"&nbsp;&#127823;. Created as part of [strawberry2892&nbsp;&#127827;'s](https://github.com/strawberry2892) school project.

## Description

On the site, you can study idioms in detail, and then test your knowledge by taking a test.

The site provides information about&nbsp;21&nbsp;idioms in English with the meaning "Fruit". For each idiom it is indicated:
- translation into Russian (meaning)
- literal translation
- synonyms in English
- examples of usage with translation
- the origin of the idiom (brief reference)

These mini-articles are based on English textbooks and English-Russian dictionaries of idioms (for more information, see [Resources](#resources)).

To consolidate the studied material, the site presents four categories of tasks:

- choose the translation of the idiom into Russian from the suggested options
- connect the two parts of the idiom
- insert a suitable idiom into a sentence
- write a translation of the idiom into English

After sending, you can view and correct your mistakes (the form can be sent several times). The percentage of correct answers is shown.
